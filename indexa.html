<h1>The Best Movies according to Kevin</h1>

<h2>My Top 4 movies all-time</h2>

<hr/>

<h3>Silent Voice</h3>
<p>An animated movie about the struggles of depression, bullying, disabilities, and in a way, relationships with loved ones in general</p>

<h3>World War Z</h3>
<p> One of the most profound effects it had on me when I first watched it as a kid was the existential dread of apocalypse being here, 
    and how simply hopeless life would be, knowing your dreams are as dead as the zombies.
</p>

<h3>The Grand Budapest Hotel</h3>
<p>Silly although very thoughtful film, that showed me how life can be fun and amazing as how you treat it, whether through adventure
    , kindess, or any measure of action that you do.
